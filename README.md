# Solid Test Task

This repository contains my solution to the Flutter test task, which is to create a simple Flutter app that displays the text "Hello there" in the middle of the screen. Additionally, tapping anywhere on the screen should change the background color to a randomly generated color.

This repository includes Flutter tests to ensure the correctness and functionality of the code.
